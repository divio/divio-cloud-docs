Leaving Divio 
================

As much as we want to host your projects, we want you to stay with us because you want to, not because you can't leave.

You're free to leave any time, and you'll find it very easy to take everything with you.

Divio has been designed to make moving off the platform, with all your data, applications and files, not just possible,
but easy and convenient. 

You can pull down the entire site to your own computer with a single command. You can also pull databases, media files
and so on separately.

Licensing conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no licensing conditions applying to any of the software we use or provide as part of your application that
preclude its use anywhere else.

Redeployment elsewhere
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Divio's architecture makes it even easier to redeploy elsewhere. Your entire Divio site is available as a Docker
container, that can be deployed anywhere that Docker is available.

If you don't want to use Docker, you'll still have a very standard project that you can put into production on another
platform or server.
