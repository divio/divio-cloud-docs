Divio developer handbook
========================

`Divio <https://divio.com>`_ is a cloud infrastructure management service, with a platform for containerised
web application deployment.

Divio aims to provide a better way to develop, deploy, scale and maintain web applications, and manage the
infrastructure they run on, using workflows you're familiar with and open-source tools you can trust.

Applications deployed on Divio can be created with any stack, platform or language.

They are containerised using Docker, versioned in Git and can be deployed to any one of multiple global cloud regions.
Each application is provided with :ref:`multiple environments <environments>` (Test, Live, etc), with its own services
(:ref:`database, storage <services>`, backups, :ref:`metrics <metrics>`, logging and more). Services are provisioned
automatically for each environment.

For the convenience of developers, Divio includes comprehensive developer tools, and a powerful :ref:`local development
environment <local-cli>`.
