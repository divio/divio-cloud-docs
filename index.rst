Divio Documentation
===================

`Divio <https://divio.com>`_ is a multi cloud infrastructure management 
service, with a platform for containerised web application deployment.

Divio aims to provide a better way to develop, deploy, scale and maintain web 
applications, and manage the infrastructure they run on, using workflows 
you're familiar with and open-source tools you can trust.

Applications deployed on Divio can be created with any stack, platform or 
language.

They are containerised using Docker, versioned in Git and can be deployed to 
any one of multiple global cloud regions. Each application is provided with 
:ref:`multiple environments <environments>` (Test, Live, etc), with its own 
services (:ref:`database, storage <services>`, backups, :ref:`metrics <metrics>`,
logging and more). Services are provisioned  automatically for each environment.

For the convenience of developers, Divio includes comprehensive developer tools, 
and a powerful :ref:`local development environment <local-cli>`.
