Configure static file serving
===================================

The site's static files need to be handled properly.

The Django runserver provides a lot of convenience. An example is that it will (as long as ``DEBUG = True``)
automatically serve static files such as CSS without additional configuration. When you run the site using uWSGI, for
example in a cloud deployment, or when ``DEBUG = False``, static files are not automatically served. You can try
loading the `fonts.css <http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/admin/css/fonts.css>`_ static file in each configuration as a test.

When running with a production server like uWSGI, you need to configure static file serving explicitly. There are
multiple ways to do this, but one very good way to do so on the `Divio infrastructure <https://www.divio.com>`_ is to 
use the Python library `WhiteNoise <https://whitenoise.evans.io>`_. WhiteNoise is designed to work behind Content 
Delivery Networks and integrates well with Django.

Add ``whitenoise`` to the ``requirements.txt``:

..  code-block:: text

    whitenoise==5.2.0

In ``settings.py``, add it to the list of ``MIDDLEWARE``, after the ``SecurityMiddleware``:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    MIDDLEWARE = [
        'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
        'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
        [...]
    ]

And to have it cache and compress static files, and to tell Django where to put collected static files, at the end
of the settings file add:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 2-3

    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'

Rebuild the image to have WhiteNoise installed.

Now, collect the static files to their destination for serving:

..  code-block:: bash

    docker-compose run web python manage.py collectstatic

You can check that uWSGI and WhiteNoise are serving the static files as expected by:

* commenting out the ``command`` line in ``docker-compose.yml`` (to ensure that the runserver isn't handling them), and
* setting ``DEBUG`` in ``settings.py`` to ``False`` (to ensure that they aren't being served by :ref:`Django's built-in
  static file serving <django:serving-static-files-in-development>`).


And now you should be able to load http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/admin/css/fonts.css.

Revert any temporary changes to ``docker-compose.yml`` and ``settings.py``. Then, commit and push your changes
(including the new ``staticfiles`` directory), deploy the Test environment, and check that static files work as expected
there too.

------------

The application can now handle static files, and will do so in an appropriate way for whichever environment the code is
running in. The next step is to configure storage and serving of media (i.e. user-uploaded) files.
