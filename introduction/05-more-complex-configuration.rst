Configure a more complex application
====================================

In the :ref:`previous section of the tutorial <tutorial-add-applications>`, we
added an application and deployed it. However, the installation process was extremely simple and
required very minimal configuration.

In practice, adding a Django application to a project will generally require more complex configuration.

We'll explore this by adding `Django Debug Toolbar
<https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ to the project.


Add django-debug-toolbar to ``requirements.in``
-----------------------------------------------

The `Django Debug Toolbar installation notes
<https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html>`_ suggest to install it using ``pip install
django-debug-toolbar``. The latest stable version at the time of writing is 2.2, so add::

    django-debug-toolbar==2.2

to ``requirements.in``.

:ref:`As before <tutorial-add-requirements>`, run ``docker-compose build web`` to rebuild the project with the new
requirement.


Configure ``settings.py``
----------------------------

Django Debug Toolbar requires various settings to be configured.


Configure INSTALLED_APPS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Debug Toolbar requires ``django.contrib.staticfiles`` and ``debug_toolbar`` to
be present in ``INSTALLED_APPS``. Is ``django.contrib.staticfiles`` already there? There's an easy way to check: run

..  code-block:: bash

    docker-compose run web python manage.py diffsettings

The Django :djadmin:`diffsettings <django:diffsettings>` management command shows the differences between your settings
and Django's defaults. In this case it should reassure us that ``django.contrib.staticfiles`` is already there as it's
included in Divio Django projects by default, so we just need to add ``debug_toolbar``.

However, we don't want to load the Debug Toolbar into the project unless we're running in with Django's Debug mode
enabled (doing so could expose data and configuration that we definitely should not share with the outside world.) So,
in the configuration, we'll check for this (with ``if DEBUG:``) before enabling any Django Debug Toolbar components.

..  code-block:: python

    if DEBUG:

        INSTALLED_APPS.extend(["debug_toolbar"])


Configure middleware settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`The installation documents note that we must set up the middleware
<https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#middleware>`_, and that it should come as soon
as possible in the list "after any other middleware that encodes the responseâ€™s content, such as ``GZipMiddleware``."

A suitable place would be right after ``django.middleware.gzip.GZipMiddleware``, and we can use a little Python list
manipulation to insert it there:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 5-8

    if DEBUG:

        INSTALLED_APPS.extend(["debug_toolbar"])

        MIDDLEWARE.insert(
            MIDDLEWARE.index("django.middleware.gzip.GZipMiddleware") + 1,
            "debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware"
            )

This will find the ``GZipMiddleware`` in the list, and insert the ``DebugToolbarMiddleware`` immediately after it.


Triggering the toolbar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The toolbar should only be triggered if certain conditions are met. By default, it's only if ``DEBUG = True`` *and* the
server IP address is `listed in INTERNAL_IPS
<https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#configuring-internal-ips>`_.

With Docker, we don't have a way to know what internal IP address a project will have, so we can't rely on that.
However, relying on ``DEBUG`` will be enough, so we define a function that will serve as a ``SHOW_TOOLBAR_CALLBACK``
callback to replace the default.

At the end of the ``settings.py`` file, add:

..  code-block:: python

    def show_toolbar(request):
        return DEBUG

    DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG = {"SHOW_TOOLBAR_CALLBACK": show_toolbar}


Configure ``urls.py``
---------------------

We need to include the ``debug_toolbar.urls`` in the project's URL configuration. Our approach here is similar: we only
want it active in ``DEBUG`` mode, so add this to the end of your project's ``urls.py``:

..  code-block:: python

    from django.conf import settings

    if settings.DEBUG:

        from django.urls import include, path
        import debug_toolbar
        urlpatterns = [
            path('__debug__/', include(debug_toolbar.urls)),
        ] + urlpatterns


See the results
---------------

And that's it (Debug Toolbar has no database tables, so you don't need to run migrations).

Visit the admin to see the Debug Toolbar in action.
