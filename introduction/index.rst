Tutorials
=========

These tutorials are suitable for developers. They assume that you are reasonably familiar with
using the command line for development work, and that you know how to use and manage things such as
Git, Pip and SSH keys.

If not, `our tutorial for non-developers
<http://support.divio.com/academy/basic-how-to-build-a-website-and-blog-with-dja
ngo-cms-60-minutes/introduction>`_ will be a better starting point.
