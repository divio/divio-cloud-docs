Run the set-up script
---------------------

This step is required as part of the beta implementation of the PHP/Laravel application type, and will be
refined in later releases.

You'll find a script in ``divio/setup.php`` that helps set up the application for local development purposes, and 
performs database migrations. Run it with:

..  code-block:: bash

    docker-compose run web php /app/divio/setup.php

This takes a few minutes. Once complete, you can run your application.


Start the local application
---------------------------

Start the application by running ``docker-compose up`` in the terminal::

    âžœ docker-compose up
    tutorial-project_database_default_1 is up-to-date
    Starting tutorial-project_web_1 ... done
    Attaching to tutorial-project_database_default_1, tutorial-project_web_1
    database_default_1  | 2020-07-14 16:38:39+00:00 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Entrypoint script for MySQL Server 5.6.49-1debian9 started.
    [...]
    database_default_1  | 2020-07-14 16:44:42 1 [Note] Event Scheduler: Loaded 0 events
    database_default_1  | 2020-07-14 16:44:42 1 [Note] mysqld: ready for connections.
    database_default_1  | Version: '5.6.49'  socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'  port: 3306  MySQL Community Server (GPL)
    web_1               | Laravel development server started: http://0.0.0.0:80


Open the application in your web browser by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000.

(You may notice above that Laravel claims to be running on port 80, not port 8000. It is - but that's only *inside* the
container. The ``docker-compose.yml`` configuration file is responsible for :ref:`this port-mapping
<docker-compose-web>`.)

``CONTROL-C`` will stop the application.

..  include:: /introduction/includes/03-local-2-useful-commands.rst


..  code-block:: bash

    docker-compose run web composer install

This will run the ``composer install`` inside the container (in fact this is one of the commands in the ``setup.php``
script you ran earlier).
