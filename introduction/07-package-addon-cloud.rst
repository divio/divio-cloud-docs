Package an addon (deployment)
===================================

..  admonition:: This tutorial assumes your project uses Django 1.11

    At the time of writing, version 1.11 is `Django's Long-Term Support release
    <https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions>`_, and is
    guaranteed support until at least April 2020.
    
    If you use a different version, you will need to modify some of the code
    examples and version numbers of packages mentioned.


Our Django Debug Toolbar Addon can now install and configure itself in a local
project; next is to complete the work of packaging it so that it can do the
same in a Divio Cloud project online.

As noted previously, when addons are installed into projects from the Control
Panel, they can expose their settings to the user via a web form in the
``aldryn_config.py`` file.


Add a field to the configuration form
-------------------------------------

We'll add a checkbox field, to control whether the user wants the Debug Toolbar
to be active or not. The value of the new ``enable_debug_toolbar`` field will
be passed to the ``to_settings()`` method, in the ``data`` dictionary. Then
we'll also test for ``data['enable_debug_toolbar']`` before enabling the
Toolbar:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3-7, 13

    class Form(forms.BaseForm):

        enable_debug_toolbar = forms.CheckboxField(
            'Enable Django Debug Toolbar',
            required=False,
            initial=True,
        )

        [...]

        def to_settings(self, data, settings):

            if settings["DEBUG"] and data['enable_debug_toolbar']:

                [...]


We can't actually test this locally - we'll have to upload it before we can do
that.


Add the remaining packaging files
---------------------------------

``LICENSE``
^^^^^^^^^^^

The addon needs a ``LICENSE``, so download that from the Control Panel and move
it to the package.


``MANIFEST.in``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do the same for the ``MANIFEST.in``. The default ``MANIFEST.in`` lists the
licence file as well as other directories that an addon is likely to have,
though we don't use any of those in this addon.


``addon.json``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The final packaging file is specific to the Divio Cloud, ``addon.json``, which
provides some additional metadata::

    {
        "package-name": "tutorial-django-debug-toolbar",
        "installed-apps": [
            "tutorial_django_debug_toolbar"
        ]
    }

Download it and add it to the addon.


Validate and upload the addon
-----------------------------

Make sure you're in the ``addons-dev/tutorial-django-debug-toolbar`` directory.

Now, running ``divio addon validate`` should now confirm that the addon is
valid::

    ➜ divio addon validate
    Addon is valid!

and it's ready to be uploaded with ``divio addon upload``::

    ➜  divio addon upload
    warning: no files found matching '*' under directory '*/boilerplates'
    warning: no files found matching '*' under directory '*/templates'
    warning: no files found matching '*' under directory '*/static'
    warning: no files found matching '*' under directory '*/locale'
    warning: check: missing required meta-data: url

    ok
    Configuration file is valid


    New version 1.8.0.1 of tutorial-django-debug-toolbar uploaded to alpha channel

    Configure your addon here https://control.divio.com/account/my-addons/878/

Don't worry about the warnings - as long as there are no errors, all is in
order.

As the output notes, this version of the addon has been placed into the *Alpha*
release channel. If you visit its *Versions* page, you'll be able to change
the release channel.


Install the addon in a Cloud project
------------------------------------

If you now visit your project (or any project you have access to) in the
Control Panel, and select its *Addons* menu, you'll be able to select, install
and configure your new addon, complete with the checkbox field you created
earlier.

If you deploy your Stage server, you'll have the Debug Toolbar running in the
cloud project.


Manage the addon via the Control Panel
--------------------------------------

You can manage your addon, moving particular versions of it into the *Beta* or
*Stable* channels, make it public and so on.

If you make it public, then other users will be able to use it in their projects
too.
