Create a new Wagtail Django application
=======================================

In this section we will create and deploy a new application in the Control Panel using 
`Wagtail <https://wagtail.io/>`_, a very popular Django-based content management system framework. The principles 
covered by the tutorial will apply to any other development stack.

You could equally well create a plain Django application, and install Wagtail in that. However, the Wagtail application 
type saves some time by setting up a ready-to-go application, with Wagtail automatically installed and configured.

..  note::

    This tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with Wagtail. It is intended to introduce the basics of working with
    the Aldryn Django framework on Divio, using Wagtail as an example. **It is not a tutorial for learning Wagtail (or
    Django)**.

    We also provide tutorials to get started with Django

    *  :ref:`from scratch <tutorial-django-set-up>`.
    *  :ref:`using the Aldryn Django framework <tutorial-aldryn-set-up>`.

* *Platform*: ``Python 3.x``
* *Application type*: ``Wagtail``

..  admonition:: Wagtail 2.14.1

    At the time of writing, the latest default version Aldryn Wagtail addon uses Wagtail 2.14.1 - others are also
    available.

Since this is your own application, you can use our :ref:`single-sign-on <aldryn-sso>` to log in by selecting **Log in 
with Divio**. You'll see the "Welcome to Wagtail" page.

More interesting are the admin pages:

* the Wagtail admin, at ``/admin``, shown below
* the Django admin, at ``/django-admin``
