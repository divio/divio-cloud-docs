How to upload your SSH public key to `Divio <https://www.divio.com>`_
=====================================================================

You will need to upload your SSH public key to our Control Panel to use some of our services.

We support RSA and ECDSA keys, but not DSA or ED25519.

Copy your public key. Select *Add SSH key* in `your account settings <https://control.divio.com/account/ssh-keys/>`_,
and paste the key.


If you need to create an SSH key
--------------------------------

If you havenâ€™t already done so, you will need to create an SSH key. We recommend `GitHub's excellent guides on checking
and generating SSH keys <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_.
