How to add and manage collaborators
====================================

Divio allows you to manage applications and collaborators using organisations. An organisation is free to create, and 
you may add and manage developers and even customers with varying access levels, as collaborators as many as you need.

Collaborator types
------------------

* *Owner* collaborator set by default upon creation of the organisation and has full control over the organisation, all
  its applications and collaborators.
* *Administrator* collaborators will have access to the organisation and all applications in it.  
* *Regular* collaborators will not have access to applications in the organisation until they are explicitly given
  access through adding applications they should have access to. 

Add a collaborator to an organisation
--------------------------------------

* Select the organisation to which you would like to add the collaborator.
* From the organisations *settings*, select *collaborators* and *add collaborators*. 
* Add your collaboratorâ€™s email address and select whether you want to provide *regular* or *administrator*
  permissions. Your new collaborator will receive a confirmation email and will need to verify their account. 

If the collaborator you invite does not have a Divio account, they will have the option to create one. The email address
you use to invite a collaborator must match their account email address.

Until the account is confirmed by your collaborator, you will see a *pending*  status attached to the new user.

Once the account is confirmed, your new collaborator is a member of the organisation. 


Add a collaborator to an application
------------------------------------

A collaborator to be added to an application must be a member of the organisation the application belongs to. 

In the application's Dashboard, select *collaborators* and click on the field under the *add available collaborators to 
this application*, choose the email of the collaborator and hit *add collaborators*.


Remove collaborators
--------------------

An admin collaborator can remove another admin but not oneself. To remove a collaborator from an organisation, in the
organisation settings, select collaborators, and click on the options menu for a particular collaborator and select
*remove*.

To revoke access of a collaborator from an application, in the application's Dashboard, select *collaborators*, and hit 
the *delete icon* for a particular collaborator.
