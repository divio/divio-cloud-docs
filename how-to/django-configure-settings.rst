How to configure Django settings
================================

In Django projects, settings are handled via the :doc:`settings <django:topics/settings>` module (usually, the ``settings.py`` file).

Settings can be added to this file in the usual way, but in Divio projects, some settings need to be inspected and
manipulated programatically, to allow the addons system to handle configuration automatically. See
:ref:`application-configuration` for more on how this works.

This can entail a little extra work when you need to change settings yourself, but the huge
convenience it offers is more than worth the effort.

The correct way to manage settings such as ``INSTALLED_APPS`` is to manipulate the existing value,
after having loaded the settings from the addons with ``aldryn_addons.settings.load(locals())``.
For example, in the default ``settings.py`` you will find::

    import aldryn_addons.settings
    aldryn_addons.settings.load(locals())

    INSTALLED_APPS.extend([
        # add your project specific apps here
    ])

This allows you to add items to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` without overwriting existing items, by
manipulating the list.

You will need to do the same for other configured settings, which will include:

* ``MIDDLEWARE`` (or the older ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``)
* ``TEMPLATES`` (or the older ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``, ``TEMPLATE_DEBUG`` and other
  template settings)
* application-specific settings, for example that belong to django CMS or Wagtail. See each
  application's :ref:`aldryn_config.py <configure-with-aldryn-config>` file for the settings it will configure.


Inserting an item at a particular position
------------------------------------------

Sometimes it's not enough just to *add* an application or class to a list. It may need to be
added before another item. Say you need to add your application ``security`` just before ``cms``. In this case you can target ``cms`` in the list like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS.insert(
        INSTALLED_APPS.index("cms") + 0,
        "security"
    )

(``+ 0`` will insert the new item ``"security"`` immediately before ``"cms"`` in the list).

Of course you can use Python to manipulate the collections in any way you require.


Manipulating more complex settings
----------------------------------

Note that in the case of more complex settings, like ``TEMPLATES``, which is no
longer a simple list, you can't just extend them directly with new items, you'll need to dive into
them to target the right list in the right dictionary, for example::

     TEMPLATES[0]["OPTIONS"]["context_processors"].append('my_application.some_context_processor')

Listing applied settings
------------------------

The Django :djadmin:`diffsettings <django:diffsettings>` management command
will show the differences between your settings and Django's defaults, for
example with::

    docker-compose run web python manage.py diffsettings

In some projects (with addons that manipulate settings late in the start-up
process), you may get an error: ``RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during
iteration``.

In this case you can run a script to print out your settings::

    from django.conf import settings

    settings.configure()

    django_settings = {}

    for attr in dir(settings):
        value = getattr(settings, attr)
        django_settings[attr] = value

    for key, value in django_settings.items():
        if not key.startswith('_'):
            print('%s = %r' % (key, value))
