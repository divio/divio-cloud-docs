How to create a Django application with our quickstart repository
=========================================================================

The `Django Divio quickstart <https://github.com/divio/django-divio-quickstart>`_ repository is a template that gives
you the fastest possible way of launching a new Django application on Divio.

It uses a completely standard Django project as created by the Django ``startproject`` management command.

The only additions are a few lines of glue code in ``settings.py`` to handle configuration using environment variables,
plus some additional files to take care of the Docker set-up.


Clone the repository
--------------------

Run:

..  code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:divio/django-divio-quickstart.git

The application contains a module named ``quickstart``, containing ``settings.py`` and other application-level 
configuration.
