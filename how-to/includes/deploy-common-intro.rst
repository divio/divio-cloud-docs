This document will take you step-by-step through the tasks required to set up a portable, vendor-neutral application,
for deployment to Divio using Docker. The application architecture we adopt is in line with `Twelve-factor
<https://www.12factor.net/config>`_ design principles.

Use the guide to help you adapt an existing application for Docker or check that your existing Docker application will 
run on `Divio <https://www.divio.com>`_. The exact steps you need to take will depend on details of your application.
