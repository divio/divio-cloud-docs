Deployment
----------

Your application is ready for deployment on our cloud platform. The basic steps are:

* create a project on the Divio Control Panel, with any required services
* push your code/connect your Git repository
* deploy one or more cloud environments

These steps are covered in more detail in :ref:`deploy`.
