..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-intro.rst

    Add a note about scope and about other guides [recommended]

..  todo::

    Add a note about base images [required] - example:

    For a Python application, use the following:

    ..  code-block:: Dockerfile

        FROM python:3.8

    Here, ``python:3.8`` is the name of the Docker *base image*. We cannot advise on what base image you should use;
    you'll need to use one that is in-line with your application's needs. However, once you have a working set-up, it's
    good practice to move to a more specific base image - for example ``python:3.8.1-slim-buster``.

    Any requirements should be pinned as firmly as possible.
