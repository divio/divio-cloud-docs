How to transfer an application to another organisation
======================================================

Applications can be moved to different organisations you belong to. 

To transfer an application to another organisation, first you must cancel its subscription via the Subscription view. An
application cannot be transferred while it has a subscription applied.

.. note:: For applications with *Business subscriptions* only: 

    If you don't want to interrupt the subscription, please contact Divio support and we can transfer the application
    without any downtime for you.

Once the subscription has been cancelled, select *Transfer* from the application's options menu, in the organisation 
view:

or in the application view:

Then you can select the new organisation for the application.
