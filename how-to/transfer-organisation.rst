How to transfer a project to another organisation
=================================================

Projects can be moved to different organisations you belong to. 

To transfer a project to another organisation, first you must cancel its subscription via the Subscription view. A
project cannot be transferred while it has a subscription applied.

.. note:: For projects with *Business subscriptions* only: 

    If you don't want to interrupt the subscription, please contact Divio support and we can transfer the project
    without any downtime for you.

Once the subscription has been cancelled, select *Transfer* from the project's options menu, in the organisation view:

or in the project view:

Then you can select the new organisation for the project.
