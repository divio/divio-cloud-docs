       Twelve-factor principles, for deployment on Divio.

How to configure an existing Flask application for deployment on `Divio <https://www.divio.com>`_
=================================================================================================

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-intro.rst

The steps here should work with any Flask application, and include configuration for:

* Postgres or MySQL database
* cloud media storage using S3
* static file handling using `WhiteNoise <https://whitenoise.evans.io>`_
* configuring a gateway server.


..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-prerequisites.rst

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-dockerfile.rst

For a Flask application, you can use:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile

    FROM python:3.8

Here, ``python:3.8`` is the name of the Docker *base image*. We cannot advise on what base image you should use;
you'll need to use one that is in-line with your application's needs. However, once you have a working set-up, it's
good practice to move to a more specific base image - for example ``python:3.8.1-slim-buster``.

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-dockerfile-working-directory.rst

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-dockerfile-application-dependencies.rst

..  code-block:: Dockerfile

    # install dependencies listed in the repository's requirements file
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

The ``requirements.txt`` file should pin Python dependencies as firmly possible (use the output from ``pip
freeze`` to get a full list). You will probably need to include some of the following:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile
    :emphasize-lines: 1-3, 5-7

    # Select one of the following for the database as required
    psycopg2==2.8.5
    mysqlclient==2.0.1

    # Select one of the following for the gateway server
    uwsgi==2.0.19.1
    gunicorn==20.0.4

Check that the version of Flask is correct, and include any other Python components required by your application.


..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-dockerfile-file-building.rst

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-dockerfile-cmd.rst

..  code-block:: Dockerfile

    # Select one of the following application gateway server commands
    CMD uwsgi --http=0.0.0.0:80 --module="flaskr:create_app()"
    CMD gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:80 --forwarded-allow-ips="*" "flaskr:create_app()"

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-configuration-services.rst

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-helper-modules.rst

There are various Python helper module libraries available that can parse environment variables to
extract the settings so that you can apply them to the application.

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-settings-security.rst

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-settings-database.rst

Your own application should do something similar if it needs to use the database.

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-settings-static.rst

One option for Flask is to configure the web server/gateway server to handle them; using Flask's own
``send_from_directory()`` can also be used, or :doc:`whitenoise:index` - see :doc:`whitenoise:flask`.

        ports:
          - "8000:80"

The ``FLASK_APP`` variable is used by the ``flask run`` command. It assumes that your application can be found at ``flaskr``; amend this appropriately if required.
