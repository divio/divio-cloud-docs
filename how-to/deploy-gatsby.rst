How to configure an existing Gatsby application for deployment on `Divio <https://www.divio.com>`_
==================================================================================================

`Gatsby <https://www.gatsbyjs.com>`_ is very popular React-based open-source framework for creating websites and apps.

If you don't already have a working Gatsby application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :ref:`quickstart-gatsby`. Or, if you already have a suitable version of Node installed, you can do:

..  code-block:: bash

    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    gatsby new hello-world https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world

and then in the new directory:

..  code-block:: bash

    gatsby develop -H 0.0.0.0 -p 8000

to see it running locally.

.. _deploy-gatsby-dockerfile:

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-dockerfile.rst

For a Gatsby application, you can use:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile

    FROM node:14.15.1-alpine

``14.15.1-alpine`` is the name of the Docker *base image*. We cannot advise on what base image you should use; you'll
need to use one that is in-line with your application's needs. It's good practice to use a specific base image - for
example ``node:14.15.1-alpine`` above (rather than say just ``node:14``).

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-dockerfile-base-images.rst

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-dockerfile-system-dependencies.rst

In this case, we can use APK since we are using an Alpine Linux base image:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile

    RUN apk add --no-cache \
      make g++ && \
      apk add vips-dev fftw-dev --update-cache \
      && rm -fR /var/cache/apk/*

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-dockerfile-working-directory.rst

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-dockerfile-application-dependencies.rst

Assuming you're using a ``package.json``/``package-lock.json``:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile

    RUN npm install
    RUN npm install -g gatsby-cli

It's important to pin dependencies as firmly as possible.

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-dockerfile-file-building.rst

For Gatsby, add:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile

    RUN gatsby build

.. _deploy-gatsby-dockerfile-cmd:

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-dockerfile-cmd.rst

A suitable command for Gatsby would be:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile

    CMD gatsby serve --port 80 --host 0.0.0.0

However if your ``package.json`` already includes a suitable entry in its ``scripts`` section, you could also make use
of that, so for example:

..  code-block::

    "scripts": {
      ...
      "deploy": "gatsby serve --port 80 --host 0.0.0.0"
    },

and in the ``Dockerfile`` instead use:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile

    CMD npm run deploy

.. _deploy-gatsby-configuration:

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-configuration-services.rst

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-helper-modules.rst

Rather than re-inventing the wheel when it comes to reading and applying configuration from environment variables,
we advise to make use of existing helper modules that have solved this problem already.

.. _deploy-gatsby-env-local:

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-compose-env-local.rst

..  code-block:: text
    :emphasize-lines: 2-3

    # Select one of the following for the database
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@database_default:5432/db

    # Storage will use local file storage in the data directory
    DEFAULT_STORAGE_DSN=file:///data/media/?url=%2Fmedia%2F

In cloud environments, we provide a number of useful variables. If your application needs to make use of them (see a
:ref:`Django example <deploy-django-security>`) you should provide them for local use too. For example:

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-compose-summary.rst

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-buildrun-build.rst

Building on the host as an option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you uncomment the:

..  code-block:: YAML

    # - ".:/app:rw"

entry in the ``web:volumes`` section of ``docker-compose.yml``, the entire ``/app`` directory will be overridden by the
application files from the host. This can be useful for development. However, you will now need to run the commands 
``npm install`` and ``gatsby build`` on the host as well in order to regenerate the files so that the container sees 
them.

..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-buildrun-run.rst


..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-git.rst

For a basic application you'll probably need at least:

..  code-block:: text

    # used by the Divio CLI
    .divio
    /data.tar.gz

    # for local file storage
    /data


..  include:: /how-to/includes/deploy-common-deploy.rst
