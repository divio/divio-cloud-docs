How to manage redirects in Aldryn Django projects
==================================================

..  Seealso:: :ref:`domains`

.. _django_protocol_redirects:

Protocol redirects
------------------

Divio projects are HTTPS-ready by default, and we provide free SSL certificates on all projects.

To force redirect from HTTP to HTTPS in Django, set the :ref:`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT <security-middleware-settings>`
environment variable to ``True``.


.. _domain_name_redirects:

Domain name redirects
---------------------

You can set up your site's domains using the domains section of the Control Panel. This includes the ability
to set a primary and secondary domains. The secondary domains can each be set to redirect to the primary domain if
required.

The domains that are to be redirected to the primary domain can also be managed
manually, via :ref:`DOMAIN_REDIRECTS`. Note that doing this overrides all settings applied in the
Control Panel - so if you use ``DOMAIN_REDIRECTS``, you will need to list all the domains there yourself.


.. _language_redirects:

Language redirects
------------------

Django provides redirection to the the default language URL when none is
specified. (In addition, django CMS offers complex fallback options for
unavailable languages.)

For example, ``/about`` will redirect to ``/en/about`` if English is the
default language.

:ref:`aldryn-django <aldryn-django>` can be configured to not use the prefix
for the default language, by checking the :ref:`Remove URL language prefix for
default language <PREFIX_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE>` checkbox on the settings for the
Aldryn Django addon in the Control Panel.


Permanent redirects
-------------------

:ref:`ALDRYN_SITES_REDIRECT_PERMANENT` will force permanent redirects for protocol and domain directs. This is to be
:ref:`used with caution <301vs302>`.
