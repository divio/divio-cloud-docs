What is Aldryn?
===============

.. _Divio: https://www.divio.com
.. |Divio| replace:: **Divio**

Sometimes our users are puzzled by references to something called **Aldryn**. **Aldryn is the former name of** 
|Divio|_, in honour of Buzz Aldrin, the astronaut. So whenever you encounter **Aldryn**, just read it |Divio|_.
 
You'll still see some references to it in our addons, code, domain names and documentation.

The name lives on internally, including in code and the names of various addons. For example, you'll find a number of
Addons called things like *Aldryn Django*. One particularly visible example is in the URLs of your 
`Divio applications <https://www.divio.com>`_, for example: *https://django-cms-stage.us.aldryn.io*. 

Changing such names now would cause a degree of inconvenience that would outweigh any benefits, so for the time being at
least, you'll continue to see *Aldryn* in various places.

Eventually, you'll see the name less and less, but until then, it just means: `Divio <https://www.divio.com>`_.
