Project creation options
==============================

A Divio application is defined by the code in its Git repository.

When a new application is created on the Control Panel, some pre-defined project types can also be used (based on a
combination of *Stack*, *Additional components* and *Additional Boilerplate*).

Generally, you will select *Build your own* and construct your own ``Dockerfile``. See :ref:`how-to-existing-web-application` for guidance.

We also provide some pre-built project templates for Aldryn Python, Node, PHP, Java and others (see :ref:`below
<project-creation-pre-built>`).

Additional components
----------------------

Additional components *may* be available, depending on the selected Stack.

For the Aldryn Python platform, examples include Django and django CMS; for the PHP platform, Laravel and
Symfony, and so on.

Additional Boilerplate
-----------------------

   :alt: 'project creation Additional boilerplate options'

Additional Boilerplates *may* be available, depending on the selected Additional components.

Boilerplates provide additional functionality baked into the project. For example, an Aldryn Python/django CMS project
can be launched with Boilerplates for Bootstrap, Foundation and other technologies.

Git repository manager

By default, your project will use Divio's own private Git server. Alternatively you can select a Git provider of your
choice. You can :ref:`migrate a project from our Git server to an external provider at any time
<configure-version-control>`.

For a quick start, use Divio's Git server.

About pre-built project templates
---------------------------------

We also provide some optional ready-to-go definitions for a quick start. For example:

* **Stack**: *Aldryn Python*
* **Additional components**: *django CMS*
* **Additional Boilerplate**: *HTML5*

It's important to understand that these pre-built project templates are simply there to provide you with a quick way to
get started with a particular stack. They don't prevent you from adding other components.
