Anatomy of a Divio addon
========================

Basic file structure
--------------------

For an addon "Susan Example Application"::

    addons-dev/
        susan-example-application/
            addon.json
            LICENSE
            MANIFEST.in
            README.rst
            setup.py
            susan_example_application/
                __init__.py



.. _aldryn-config:

``aldryn_config.py``
--------------------

All addons have an ``aldryn_config.py`` file that takes care of settings, which
are then loaded into :ref:`settings.py <settings.py>`.

This means that any settings you need to apply in a project can't simply be
applied in your ``settings.py`` if an addon also needs access to them.

For example, nearly every addon will add a package, or sometimes several, to
``INSTALLED_APPS``. If you were to assign do ``INSTALLED_APPS = [...]`` in the
usual way, you would overwrite the existing assignments and break the project.
That's why our ``settings.py`` uses::

    INSTALLED_APPS.extend([
        # add your project specific apps here
    ])

The same goes for middleware, and other settings.

``aldryn_config.py`` is loaded into the Django project at runtime, so any
changes are picked up when and reloaded automatically when developing.

``aldryn_config.py`` is an ideal place to check for environment variables that
should be :ref:`converted into Django settings
<environment-variables-settings>`.

See :ref:`configure-with-aldryn-config`.


``addon.json``
--------------

A metadata file.

::

    {
        "package-name": "susan-example-application",
        "installed-apps": [
            "susan_example_application"
        ]
    }


.. _setup-py:

``setup.py``
------------

``setup.py`` will be generated by the Control Panel on the basis of the
information you provided when you first created it there. The lines highlighted
below are those that will be specific to your addon:

..  code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 2, 7, 10, 11, 14

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    from setuptools import setup, find_packages
    from susan_example_application import __version__


    setup(
        name='susan-example-application',
        version=__version__,
        description=open('README.rst').read(),
        author='Susan',
        author_email='susan@example.com',
        packages=find_packages(),
        platforms=['OS Independent'],
        install_requires=["example_application==1.8.3"],
        include_package_data=True,
        zip_safe=False,
    )
