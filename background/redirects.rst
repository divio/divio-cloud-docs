.. _redirects:

Redirects
=========

You will find various redirects at work on URLs in Divio Cloud projects.

They fall into different categories:

* :ref:`protocol_redirects` (e.g. from HTTP to HTTPS)
* :ref:`domain_name_redirects` (e.g. ``https://example.com`` to
  ``https://www.example.com``)
* :ref:`language_redirects` (e.g. ``https://example.com/about`` to
  ``https://example.com/en/about``)

All by default ``302 Temporary Redirects``.


.. _protocol_redirects:

Protocol redirects
------------------

Our projects are HTTPS-ready by default, and `we provide free SSL certificates
even on free projects
<http://support.divio.com/control-panel/projects/ssl-certificates-and-https-on-divio-cloud- projects>`_.

Adding a :ref:`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` will enable these redirects.


.. _domain_name_redirects:

Domain name redirects
---------------------

You can set up your site's domains using the `Domains section of the Control
Panel
<http://support.divio.com/control-panel/projects/using-your-own-domain-with-divio-cloud>`_.
This includes the ability to set a primary and secondary domains.
The secondary domains will redirect to the primary domain.

The domains that are to be redirected to the primary domain can also be managed
manually, via :ref:`DOMAIN_REDIRECTS`.


.. _language_redirects:

Language redirects
------------------

Django provides redirection to the the default language URL when none is
specified. (In addition, django CMS offers complex fallback options for
unavailable languages.)

For example, ``/about`` will redirect to ``/en/about`` if English is the
default language.

:ref:`aldryn-django <aldryn-django>` can be configured to not use the prefix
for the default language, by checking the :ref:`Remove URL language prefix for
default language <PREFIX_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE>` checkbox on the settings for the
Aldryn Django addon in the Control Panel.


.. _301vs302:

301 Permanent vs 302 Temporary redirects
----------------------------------------

You will sometimes see online site-checking tools encouraging the use of
permanent redirects and even flagging temporary redirects as an issue. It is
true that a permanent redirect is sometimes more appropriate, but only when it
really should be permanent, and is **guaranteed** not to change.

Protocol, domain and language directs are ``302 Temporary`` by default. ``301
Permanent`` redirects are cached by browsers - some even update their bookmarks
if they encounter a ``301``. This can cause problems if the redirects change,
potentially causing redirect loops for users (which site owners will not be
able to replicate).

However, we do offer a setting :ref:`ALDRYN_SITES_REDIRECT_PERMANENT` to force
permanent redirects for protocol and domain directs. This is to be used with
caution.
