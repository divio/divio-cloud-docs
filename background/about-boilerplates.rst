About Boilerplates
==================

As well as Django and Python applications, our Docker containerisation can
include and build frontend components into your projects.

Your project's *Boilerplate* will define the components - HTML, CSS and
JavaScript - that are set up each time the project is built.

Every Divio Cloud project includes a Boilerplate, whether it's one of our
standard Boilerplates or a custom Boilerplate of your own, which will be
selected when the project is created. At minimum, it will use our
:ref:`blank-boilerplate`.


Our built-in Boilerplates
-------------------------

.. _blank-boilerplate:

Blank Boilerplate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Blank Boilerplate <https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-boilerplate-blank>`_
installs no components. It will be up to you to install anything you need,
including templates for your site.

Unless you are creating a django CMS site, the Blank Boilerplate is the only
one we offer by default.


HTML5 Boilerplate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our `HTML5 Boilerplate <https://github.com/divio/djangocms-boilerplate-html5>`_
implements the `HTML5 Boilerplate package <https://html5boilerplate.com>`_. The
HTML5 Boilerplate package is a popular starter set of starter files, which
includes a generic HTML template, CSS to normalise and set some standard
classes, and some JavaScript including jQuery.

Our implementation of it is very standard, and simply adapts it for use in
django CMS projects.


Bootstrap and Foundation Boilerplates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our `Bootstrap <https://github.com/divio/djangocms-boilerplate-bootstrap3>`_
and `Foundation <https://github.com/divio/djangocms-boilerplate-foundation6>`_
Boilerplates implement these two popular frontend frameworks.

They are both fully-featured frameworks that include opinionated CSS and
JavaScript for your own use, and numerous built-in widgets and standardised web
components.


Sass Boilerplate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our `Sass Boilerplate <https://github.com/divio/djangocms-boilerplate-sass>`_
introduces compiled components. This is a *dynamic Boilerplate*, unlike those
above, which is to say that it compiles its own materials at runtime (the
*static Boilerplates* by contrast simply use or serve the materials they ship
with).

The Sass Boilerplate uses the `HTML5 Boilerplate package
<https://html5boilerplate.com>`_ as its basis. It uses:

* `Gulp <http://gulpjs.com>`_ to run the compilation
* `npm <https://www.npmjs.com>`_ as a package manager
* `Node <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_ as a run-time environment.

The advantage of using a dynamic Boilerplate with compiled components is that
it permits you to build a customised frontend, shorn of items your project does
not require. Compiled components can also be heavily compressed and optimised,
while the source files you work on can remain readable and comprehensive.


Webpack Boilerplate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Webpack Boilerplate
<https://github.com/divio/djangocms-boilerplate-webpack>`_ implements the
Bootstrap framework as a fully-compiled frontend set-up. It uses:

* `Gulp <http://gulpjs.com>`_ to run the compilation
* `Webpack <https://webpack.js.org>`_ to bundle all the modules
* `npm <https://www.npmjs.com>`_ as a package manager
* `Node <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_ as a run-time environment.


How Boilerplates work
---------------------

When you create a new project via the Divio Cloud Control Panel, you select a
Boilerplate at the same time.

The Control Panel examines the Boilerplate to determine what components should
then be installed.

It does this by checking:

* The ``boilerplate.json`` file (required in all Boilerplates). If templates are
specified here, they will be applied to the django CMS configuration as
available templates.

* The Boilerplate's ``Dockerfile``. Sections in the ``Dockerfile`` will be
  copied to the project's ``Dockerfile`` appropriately; for example::

    # <NODE>
    ADD build /stack/boilerplate

    ENV NODE_VERSION=6.10.1 \
        NPM_VERSION=3.10.10

    RUN bash /stack/boilerplate/install.sh

    ENV NODE_PATH=$NVM_DIR/versions/node/v$NODE_VERSION/lib/node_modules \
        PATH=$NVM_DIR/versions/node/v$NODE_VERSION/bin:$PATH
    # </NODE>

  will be copied to the::

    # <NODE>
    # </NODE>

  section.

The Control Panel will then copy all files (other than the two mentioned above)
and directories in the Boilerplate into the project, unless they are explicitly
excluded in the the ``boilerplate.json`` file's ``excluded`` list.

..  important:

    As you can see in the example above, the Dockerfile expects to find and use
    files in ``build``, that it adds to ``/stack/boilerplate``. The ``build``
    directory will need to be provided by the Boilerplate.

The Control Panel will also detect and respond automatically to the presence of
various other files in the Boilerplate. These files are:

* ``package.json`` - will be used by ``npm`` to install node packages
* ``bower.json`` and ``.bowerrc`` - will be used by Bower to install frontend
  components. Note that this is provided as legacy support. We no longer
  recommend Bower (use npm instead)
* ``gulpfile.js`` - used by Gulp execute specified compilation tasks

The Control Panel will write appropriate commands into the Dockerfile, so that
when the project is next deployed, the appropriate components will be installed
and tasks run.

Bower commands will be placed inside the ``# <BOWER>/# </BOWER>`` section of
the Dockerfile, and so on.

..  note::

    These operations are performed by the Control Panel only. They will not be
    performed in the local environment, but only on the *Test* and *Live*
    servers.

    If you make changes to these files locally, in order to see the effect
    you will need to:

    * push your changes to the Cloud, where they will be processed into the
      Dockerfile
    * pull down the project again
