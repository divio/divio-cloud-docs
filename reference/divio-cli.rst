Divio CLI
=========

The Divio CLI  is a Python-based command line application, and can be installed
via pip::

    pip install divio-cli

The CLI will run in Python 3.6 to 3.9.

The `divio-cli source code <https://github.com/divio/divio-cli>`_ is available
on GitHub.


..  _ironment-configuration:

Divio CLI configuration
-----------------------

The behaviour of the Divio CLI is managed via a JSON configuration file.


Location of the file
--------------------

The file is created by the CLI and will be found at either:

* ``~/.config/divio/config.json``, or
* ``~/.aldryn`` (the older location for the file - if this file exists it will take precedence)


File structure
--------------

The file contains a JSON dictionary, for example::

    {
        "update_check_timestamp": 1501185567,
        "skip_doctor_checks": [
            "docker-server-dns"
        ]
    }

..  _skip-doctor-checks:

Using ``skip_doctor_checks``
----------------------------

The ``skip_doctor_checks`` are particularly useful, and can be used to disable certain automated
checks run by the Divio app and the ``divio doctor`` command (for example, if you
are working offline, or with network restrictions).

The checks that ``divio doctor`` runs are classes in `check_system.py
<https://github.com/divio/divio-cli/blob/master/divio_cli/check_system.py>`_. If a check fails that you think can be
ignored, add it to the ``skip_doctor_checks`` list to disable it, as in the example above. The checks that can be
disabled are:


* ``login`` - checks that the CLI can connect to the endpoint on the Divio Control Panel.
* ``git`` - checks that Git is installed by running ``git --version``.
* ``docker-client`` checks that the Docker client is available by running ``docker --version``.
* ``docker-compose`` - checks that Docker Compose is available by running ``docker-compose --version``.
* ``docker-server`` - checks that a command can be executed in a container by running ``docker run --rm busybox``.
* ``docker-server-ping`` - checks that a Docker container has connectivity to the Internet by running::

        docker run --rm busybox sh -c "ping -c 1 -w 5 8.8.8.8"
* ``docker-server-dns`` - checks that a Docker container can resolve DNS queries by running::

        docker run --rm busybox sh -c "timeout 5 nslookup -type=a control.divio.com. || timeout -t 5 nslookup -type=a
        control.divio.com."
