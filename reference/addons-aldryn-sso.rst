.. _authentication:

Aldryn SSO (authentication)
==============================

Authentication to the Divio platform, and (by default) to user projects
running on the platform, is handled by the Divio SSO (single-sign-on)
system. This provides a convenient way to authenticate users for Divio
projects (whether locally, or on the *Test* or *Live* servers) without needing
to log in again, as long as they have logged into the Divio Control Panel.

This includes making it possible for users working on projects locally to
log in locally with a single click, as they have already been authenticated.

Divio SSO is managed by the `open-source Aldryn SSO
<https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-sso>`_ addon. The system is optional, but is
installed by default in all Divio Django projects.

If the addon is uninstalled, then Django's standard authentication behaviour
will apply.


.. _login-methods:

Login methods
-------------

The Aldryn SSO addon provides three different login methods to Divio projects:

..  image:: /images/login-options.png
    :alt: 'Illustration of Divio project login options'
    :width: 552

Depending on how the project is configured, and which environment
(local/test/live) it's running in, different combinations of these options will
be shown (you'll never see all three at once in a real project).

The illustrated options are:

.. _local-development-login:

1. Local development login
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is intended to appear on locally-running projects only. The *Add user*
option is a convenient way to add new users to a project.

See :ref:`ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_LOCALDEV`.


.. _django-login-form:

2. Django's standard username/password login form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will not be of any use unless users with passwords exist in the database.

See :ref:`ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_LOGIN_FORM`.


.. _divio-cloud-sso:

3. Divio single-sign-on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is intended to appear on projects running in Cloud environments only. It
allows users to sign in to their own projects with a single click, once they
have authenticated with the Divio control panel.

See :ref:`ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_SSO_LOGIN`.


Test site protection
--------------------

By default the *Test* site is protected so that it's not publicly discoverable
or viewable.

There are two ways in which it's possible to see a protected *Test* site:

* by being logging in as a user who is the owner or an authorised user of that site.
* by using the secret hashed URL available from the icon on the Control Panel:

  .. image:: /images/open-test-site.png
     :alt: 'Open Test site icon'
     :width: 406

  This URL can be shared with other people - for example, if you need to show
  progress on the *Test* server to someone who doesn't have a Divio account.


Aldryn SSO configuration options
--------------------------------

..  important::

    The preferred way to set these options is as environment variables.

    If you supply them as Django settings declared in :ref:`settings.py <settings.py>`, they must appear **before**
    ``aldryn_addons.settings.load(locals())``. This allows them to be processed correctly by the addons system.

    The exception is :ref:`ALDRYN_SSO_HIDE_USER_MANAGEMENT`, which is configured via the Control Panel, or by adding the
    variable *after* ``aldryn_addons.settings.load(locals())``.

More details of how Aldryn SSO processes these settings can be studied at
`aldryn-sso.aldryn_config.py
<https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-sso/blob/master/aldryn_config.py>`_.


.. _ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_LOCALDEV:

``ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_LOCALDEV``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enables :ref:`Local development login <local-development-login>`.

When ``True`` (default for the local environment only) enables the *Add user*
pane in the login form, providing a convenient way to add a new user to the
database.

Can also be specified as an environment variable or in ``settings.py``.

..  warning::

    For obvious reasons, enabling this is strongly not recommended on the
    *Test* and *Live* sites, and there is generally no good reason to
    manipulate this setting.


.. _ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_SSO_LOGIN:

``ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_SSO_LOGIN``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enables :ref:`single-sign-on <divio-cloud-sso>`.

Requires a value to be present in :ref:`SSO_DSN`, and is automatically set when
there is. If enabled when no ``SSO_DSN`` value has been set, an error will be
raised.

Can also be specified as an environment variable or in ``settings.py``.


.. _ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_LOGIN_FORM:

``ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_LOGIN_FORM``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enables :ref:`Django's standard username/password login form
<django-login-form>`.

By default, is enabled when :ref:`Hide user management
<ALDRYN_SSO_HIDE_USER_MANAGEMENT>` is **not** enabled.

Can also be specified as an environment variable or in ``settings.py``.


.. _ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_AUTO_SSO_LOGIN:

``ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_AUTO_SSO_LOGIN``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When ``True`` (the default on all sites) then if SSO login is the only login
method enabled, the user will be automatically logged-in via SSO (assuming of
course that the user is authorised to do so).

The logic for this condition is:

====================================  =========
ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_SSO_LOGIN           True
ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_AUTO_SSO_LOGIN      True
ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_LOGIN_FORM          False
ALDRYN_SSO_ENABLE_LOCALDEV            False
====================================  =========

Can also be specified as an environment variable or in ``settings.py``.


``ALDRYN_SSO_ALWAYS_REQUIRE_LOGIN``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Controls whether visitors need to be logged-in. Available options are:

* ``True``: Users will need to log in via the SSO system in order to access
  the site (default for test site).
* ``False``: No login is required (default for local and live environments).
* ``basicauth``: The site will be protected by `basic HTML access
  authorisation
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication>`_. See
  :ref:`basicauth <basic-auth>`.

Can also be specified as an environment variable or in ``settings.py``.


.. _ALDRYN_SSO_HIDE_USER_MANAGEMENT:

``ALDRYN_SSO_HIDE_USER_MANAGEMENT``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option is presented in the configuration form for the Aldryn SSO addon on
the Control Panel (as *Hide user management*). Its effect is to unregister the
``User`` and ``Group`` models in the Django admin.

Setting it as an environment variable will have no effect.

Specifying it in `settings.py` will only have an effect if it is declared
*after* ``aldryn_addons.settings.load(locals())``. This is not recommended
except for testing purposes.

For local testing, the ``hide_user_management`` value in
``aldryn-addons/aldryn-sso/settings.json`` can be changed, mimicking the
effect of the form value.


.. _basic-auth:

``ALDRYN_SSO_BASICAUTH_USER`` and ``ALDRYN_SSO_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When ``ALDRYN_SSO_ALWAYS_REQUIRE_LOGIN`` is set to ``basicauth``, access to
the entire site will require user and password details. This is an *additional
layer* of authentication. Access to the admin will still require login by an admin user, and even a logged-in admin user will need to supply the username
and password.

..  seealso::

    :ref:`password-protect-project`.

Though the username and password can be specified as an environment variable or
in ``settings.py``, the latter is not good practice.


.. _SSO_DSN:

``SSO_DSN``
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Data Source Name for single-sign-on.

This is set as an environment variable automatically in Cloud Projects,
adding the SSO authority to the URL configuration for the project.

If you are providing your own single-sign-on, ``SSO_DSN`` can also be specified
as an environment variable or in ``settings.py``.


``LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After login, redirect to the specified URL (by default, to ``/``).

Specifying ``LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`` in `settings.py` will only have an effect if
it is declared *after* ``aldryn_addons.settings.load(locals())``.


``ALDRYN_SSO_LOGIN_WHITE_LIST``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of internal endpoints that don't require authentication. Defaults to an
empty list.

For example::

    from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse_lazy

    ALDRYN_SSO_LOGIN_WHITE_LIST = [reverse_lazy('my_whitelisted_endpoint')]

Can be specified as an environment variable or in ``settings.py``, or
manipulated programmatically in other applications::

    if 'ALDRYN_SSO_LOGIN_WHITE_LIST' in settings:

        settings['ALDRYN_SSO_LOGIN_WHITE_LIST'].extend([reverse_lazy('my_whitelisted_endpoint')])


``ALDRYN_SSO_OVERIDE_ADMIN_LOGIN_VIEW``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We override Django's admin login view by default, as long as one of the
:ref:`three login options <login-methods>` is enabled. This takes better care
of logged-in users who are not staff (admin) users.

The standard Django administration login view is available by setting this to
``False`` as an environment variable or in ``settings.py``.
