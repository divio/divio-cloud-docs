.. _dockerfile-reference:

The ``Dockerfile``
==================

Each :ref:`Docker image <image-reference>` is defined by a ``Dockerfile``, that
describes what is in the image and how :ref:`containers <container-reference>`
created from it should be built.

The Dockerfile is simply a text document, containing all the commands that would be issued on the
command-line to build an image - in short, the ``Dockerfile`` defines an environment.

The Dockerfile is built automatically, and populated with appropriate commands (see below).
However, you can also add any commands you wish to the ``Dockerfile``, for example to :ref:`install
system packages <install-system-packages>`, or to configure the environment.

..  important::

    The ``Dockerfile`` executes its commands in sequence. This means that commands to install Node
    (for example) must come before commands to run Node packages.


How the ``Dockerfile`` is automatically populated
-------------------------------------------------

Hashes (``#``) in the ``Dockerfile`` indicate a comment. Sections within angle brackets are
autogenerated by the Divio Cloud Control Panel, and may be updated or changed on deployment without
warning.

Removing these wrapping tags will prevent a section being poulated or changed.


The empty ``Dockerfile`` at project creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Dockerfile`` starts life at project creation thus:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile

    # <WARNING>
    # </WARNING>

    # <DOCKER_FROM>
    # </DOCKER_FROM>

    # <NPM>
    # </NPM>

    # <BOWER>
    # </BOWER>

    # <PYTHON>
    # </PYTHON>

    # <SOURCE>
    # </SOURCE>

    # <GULP>
    # </GULP>

    # <STATIC>
    # </STATIC>

These sections are in effect placeholders for Docker commands and configuration that will be used
to define the project later.


The ``<WARNING>`` section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``<WARNING>`` is always populated.

..  code-block:: Dockerfile
    :emphasize-lines: 2-4

    # <WARNING>
    # Everything within sections like <TAG> is generated and can
    # be automatically replaced on deployment. You can disable
    # this functionality by simply removing the wrapping tags.
    # </WARNING>


The ``<DOCKER_FROM>`` section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is determined by the project's base project version. If you update the base project in the
project's *General Settings* in the Control Panel, this will be updated on the next deployment.

For a project built on the ``aldryn/base-project:py3-3.23`` image, corresponding to the *Base
Project:* ``Python 3 v3.23``:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    # <DOCKER_FROM>
    FROM aldryn/base-project:py3-3.23
    # </DOCKER_FROM>


The ``<NODE>`` section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section will be supplied by a :ref:`Boilerplate <boilerplates_reference>` that includes Node
components, for example in the `django CMS Sass Boilerplate
<https://github.com/divio/djangocms-boilerplate-sass/blob/master/Dockerfile>`_.

An example that uses other files supplied by the Boilerplate (such as ``install.sh``) to set up the
Node environment:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile
    :emphasize-lines: 2-10

    # <NODE>
    ADD build /stack/boilerplate

    ENV NODE_VERSION=6.10.1 \
        NPM_VERSION=3.10.10

    RUN bash /stack/boilerplate/install.sh

    ENV NODE_PATH=$NVM_DIR/versions/node/v$NODE_VERSION/lib/node_modules \
        PATH=$NVM_DIR/versions/node/v$NODE_VERSION/bin:$PATH
    # </NODE>


The ``<NPM>`` section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``package.json`` (specifying Node packages that should be installed) is present in the root of
the project, then instructions will be inserted to copy it to the root of the image and install the
packages.

..  code-block:: Dockerfile
    :emphasize-lines: 4-6

    # <NPM>
    # package.json is put into / so that mounting /app for local
    # development does not require re-running npm install
    ENV PATH=/node_modules/.bin:$PATH
    COPY package.json /
    RUN (cd / && npm install --production && rm -rf /tmp/*)
    # </NPM>


The ``<BOWER>`` section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If both ``bower.json`` and ``.bowerrc`` are present in the root of the project, then the
deployment process will insert:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile
    :emphasize-lines: 2-6

    # <BOWER>
    COPY bower.json .bowerrc /app/
    RUN bower install \
        --verbose \
        --allow-root \
        --config.interactive=false
    # </BOWER>


The ``<PYTHON>`` section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If either ``requirements.in`` or ``requirements.txt`` are present in the root of the project, then
the deployment process will insert appropriate instructions, that will handle installation of Divio
Cloud addons and other packages. The exact contents of this section will depend on the project; an
example for a Python 3 project:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile
    :emphasize-lines: 2-10

    # <PYTHON>
    ENV PIP_INDEX_URL=${PIP_INDEX_URL:-https://wheels.aldryn.net/v1/aldryn-extras+pypi/${WHEELS_PLATFORM:-aldryn-baseproject-py3}/+simple/} \
        WHEELSPROXY_URL=${WHEELSPROXY_URL:-https://wheels.aldryn.net/v1/aldryn-extras+pypi/${WHEELS_PLATFORM:-aldryn-baseproject-py3}/}
    COPY requirements.* /app/
    COPY addons-dev /app/addons-dev/
    RUN pip-reqs compile && \
        pip-reqs resolve && \
        pip install \
            --no-index --no-deps \
            --requirement requirements.urls
    # </PYTHON>

.. _dockerfile-source-section:

The ``<SOURCE>`` section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``SOURCE`` section copies the project files to the ``/app`` directory of the container.

..  code-block:: Dockerfile
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    # <SOURCE>
    COPY . /app
    # </SOURCE>


We do this late in our ``Dockerfile`` by default. This is because it copies the *entire* repository
into the container, meaning that if *anything* is changed in the repository, it would invalidate
all the following layers, which would have to be rebuilt from scratch rather than using cached
layers. For reasons of economy, we keep this as late as possible.

If other parts of the repository need to be copied into the container earlier in the process, these
should be explicitly specified as required.

The ``<GULP>`` section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``gulpfile.js`` is present in the root of the project, then instructions will be inserted to run
the ``gulp build`` process:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile
    :emphasize-lines: 2-3

    # <GULP>
    ENV GULP_MODE=production
    RUN gulp build
    # </GULP>


The ``<STATIC>`` section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``<STATIC>`` is always populated, with a command to copy static files to the location from where
the web server will serve them:

..  code-block:: Dockerfile
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    # <STATIC>
    RUN DJANGO_MODE=build python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
    # </STATIC>
