Aldryn Django (core Django)
===========================

Aldryn Django (``aldryn-django``) installs and provides basic configuration for Django.


Key Aldryn Django configuration options
---------------------------------------

.. _PREFIX_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE:

*Remove URL language prefix for default language*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set on the Aldryn Django configuration on the Control Panel.

When set, will add the ``aldryn_django.middleware.LanguagePrefixFallbackMiddleware`` to the
middleware.

This will cause Django **not** to use a language prefix in the URL when serving the default
language. For example, by default, ``/about`` will redirect to ``/en/about`` if English is the
default language; with this option selected, it will not (and will instead redirect in the other
direction).

Note that prior to Django version 1.10, this will not work with projects in which
multiple languages are defined.

This is a ``302 Temporary Redirect``, as determined in Django's core. It is not
safe to use permanent redirects here, because language redirects are
content-dependent. A change in the site could cause redirect loops, as
described at :ref:`301vs302`, or spurious 404 errors.


.. _SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT:

``SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When ``True``, redirects to the HTTPS version of the site.

Can be specified as an environment variable (recommended) or in ``settings.py``.

The `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT setting
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/#secure-ssl-redirect>`_ is
handled by Django's ``SecurityMiddleware``.

By default, this is a ``302 Temporary Redirect``


.. _DOMAIN_REDIRECTS:

``DOMAIN_REDIRECTS``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of domain names that will redirect to the site's primary domain name.

By default, this is populated by the Control Panel. If required, it can also be
specified as an environment variable on the Live server (recommended) or in
``settings.py``.

Setting this manually will allow you to add the internal Divio domain of the
site, such as ``example.eu.aldryn.io``, to the domains that will redirect to
the primary domain. (You may wish to do this if you don't want users or search
engines to discover your site at ``example.eu.aldryn.io`` rather than
``example.com``.)

Note that if you specify ``DOMAIN_REDIRECTS`` manually, you will need to list
all of its secondary domains, as it overrides the setting automatically
generated by the Control Panel.


.. _ALDRYN_SITES_REDIRECT_PERMANENT:

``ALDRYN_SITES_REDIRECT_PERMANENT``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, redirects are ``302 Temporary Redirect``. When ``True``, redirects
(where this is appropriate) will be ``301 Permanent Redirect``.

Can be specified as an environment variable (recommended) or in ``settings.py``.

See :ref:`301vs302` for more information.


Other options
-------------

See `aldryn-django.aldryn_config
<https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-django/blob/support/1.8.x/aldryn_config.py>`_
for the settings it takes and how they are applied. (Check that you are
referring to the appropriate version.)
