Introduction
------------

File storage on Divio applications is handled by dedicated storage systems entirely separate from the application. The
available storage depends on the Divio region your application uses. Most applications use Amazon Web Services's S3 
service, or another S3 provider. Others use Microsoft Azure blob storage.

In our architecture, the same application may be running in multiple parallel container, each with its own local file
storage independent of each of the others. Moreover, this storage is not persistent, and exists only for as long as the
lifetime of the container.

This means an application should not expect to save files to its local storage, and then expect to find them later.

Good implementations of cloud storage backends or plugins, for both S3 and Azure blog storage, exist for most mature
web frameworks and applications languages.

Working with our storage backends in Django
---------------------------------------------

For most Django applications, this won't require any additional work. Django is able to use
multiple storage backends, all addressed through a common API. This is the safe and correct way to
handle files in Django, so that applications can abstract from details of the storage
implementation, and simply not need to know about it.

As long as an application uses Django's storage API, rather than attempting to manipulate Python
File objects directly, it doesn't need to do anything differently.

Similarly, an application should not rely on knowing or manipulating a File object's file path.


.. _work-media-storage-django-default:

Use Django's defined ``DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE``, not ``FileSystemStorage``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your code may use Django's :mod:`FileSystemStorage <django:django.core.files.storage>`. This
provides basic file storage, on a filesystem local to the code. For the reasons described in the
:ref:`Introduction <work-media-storage-introduction>` it is therefore not suitable for use on
Divio.

Instead, you must use the storage as defined by Django's ``DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`` - which you can
do simply by not explicitly specifying a storage system, and using
``django.core.files.storage.default_storage``.

See also :ref:`Django's discussion <django:file storage systems>` of the subject.


File storage in third-party applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ideally, third-party applications in your application should respect this for their own file handling.

This is not always the case however. In some cases the application may need to be configured
explicitly.

For example, you may need to set ``THUMBNAIL_DEFAULT_STORAGE`` for Django's Easy Thumbnails library.

More problematically, some applications may have hard-coded expectations for the file
storage system, and these will need to be rewritten.


Private file storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our storage backend does not support private file storage (i.e. requiring authentication) on S3
objects.

If you need private storage, you can define an additional Django storage backend in your application,
which sets S3 objects to be private as required.

Whenever you need to manage private files, you will need to invoke this custom backend.

The backend can use the buckets we provide to do this, but please be aware that if you restore a
backup, or use our tools to push files, *all the files will become public*.

Alternatively, you can use a bucket of your own with this backend.


Loading media files into your applications' pages
-------------------------------------------------

Sometimes an application in your application will need to load media files using JavaScript.

Since your media files are held on a server under a different domain from the application,
browsers may refuse to allow this cross-domain loading for security reasons.

There are two solutions to this.


Load media from ``static``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One is to make sure that all files you need to load are in your site's *static* files,
rather than media. (The static files are served from the same domain as the application itself, so
browsers will be able to load files using JavaScript without complaint).

This has the advantage of not running into the possibility of using JavaScript to load
user-submitted material (which could include material uploaded by untrusted users).


Enable CORS headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The other solution is to :ref:`enable CORS ("cross-origin resource sharing") headers <interact-storage-cors>` on the media bucket, allowing the bucket to serve its resources when
requested by a page on a different domain.


Storage speed and performance
-----------------------------

Note that if you need to make many read/write operations to file storage, or are working with very
large objects, that the speed you experience on the cloud can be considerably less than what you
experience in the local development environment.

The local development environment has the advantage of locally-attached storage, and should not
necessarily be taken as a guide to performance on the cloud.

*In most cases, this won't actually matter.* However, if your code works very intensively with
storage, it can be more efficient and faster to do all that work on the application instance's own
local filesystem, in a temporary directory, and then send the finished work to the remote storage.
