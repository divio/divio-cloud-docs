.. _divio-app:

The Divio application
=====================

The Divio app is a GUI application for interacting with local projects and
the Divio Cloud.

It also sets up :ref:`the Divio Shell <divio-shell>`.

Installation
------------

When first run, the Divio app will:

*   download Docker
*   install Docker
*   launch it
*   set up a local Docker image that provides a Bash shell interface for issuing
    ``divio`` commands, even if the Divio CLI has not been installed globally


Controls
--------

Most of the controls in the Divio app correspond to :ref:`divio-cli-ref` or
:ref:`docker-compose-reference` commands. This is a list of the controls and
the corresponding commands:

The Project list
    ``divio project list``
Setup
    ``divio project setup <project slug>``
Update
    ``divio project update``
Rebuild
    ``docker-compose build web``. Note that this only rebuilds the web
    container. To rebuild all the project's containers, you will need to run
    ``docker-compose build`` in a terminal.
Reset
    ``docker-compose rm`` to tear down the project, followed by ``divio project
    setup`` to rebuild it.
Download
    Uses ``git pull`` to update the local codebase.
Media Download
    ``divio project pull media db``
Database Download
    ``divio project pull db``
Upload
    Uses ``git push`` to update the Cloud project codebase.
Upload Media
    ``divio project push media``
Upload Database
    ``divio project push db``
Start
    ``docker-compose up``
Stop
    ``docker-compose stop``
Open local site (eye icon)
    ``divio project up``
Open bash in local container
    ``docker-compose exec web /bin/bash``
Show server logs
    ``docker-compose logs -f --tail=100``

Some other controls in the Divio app also match command-line operations, though
they are in fact executed via APIs on the Control Panel:

Project Dashboard
    ``docker-compose logs -f --tail=100``
Open Test site
    ``divio project test``
Deploy
    ``divio project deploy test``


.. _divio-shell:

The Divio Shell
---------------

.. |divio-shell| image:: /images/divio-shell.png
   :alt: 'Divio Shell'
   :width: 108

The Divio Shell is a pre-configured shell environment for interacting with local Divio projects.
It's launched with the |divio-shell| button in the bottom left corner of the Divio app, and drops
you in a bash prompt, in your Divio Cloud workspace directory.


The Divio Shell is configured with the SSH keys required to give you access to our Cloud servers.
You don't have to use the Divio Shell (you can use an ordinary session in your terminal) but in
that case you will need to :ref:`set up keys yourself <add-public-key>`.


Creating the shell
------------------

The Divio app creates the shell by running a sequence of commands, expanded
here for clarification:

..  code-block:: bash

    # clear the terminal window
    clear
    # set the path for this shell
    PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
    # clears the DOCKER_HOST environment variable, in case something else has set it
    unset DOCKER_HOST
    # runs a docker command in a new container, with interactive TTY access, removing it on exit
    docker run -it --rm \
        # ... mounting  these volumes in the container:
        -v '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw' \
        -v '/Users/daniele/.netrc:/home/divio/.netrc:rw' \
        -v '/Users/daniele/.aldryn:/home/divio/.aldryn:rw' \
        -v '/Users/daniele/divio-cloud-projects:/Users/daniele/divio-cloud-projects:rw'
        # ... using the image:
        divio/divio-app-toolbox:daniele-0.10.5-daniele.procida_divio.ch
        # ... and in the new container, run the following commands:
        cd /Users/daniele/divio-cloud-projects
        divio doctor
        bash
