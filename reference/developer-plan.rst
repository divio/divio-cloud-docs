The Developer plan
===================

You can create a free Developer subscription for any Divio application. The Developer plan is ideal for working on an 
application until you are ready to go live under a paid subscription, and exploring the platform and discovering its 
features and capabilities.

To make it as useful as possible, the Developer plan includes a rich set of features. No time-limit is applied to
Developer plan subscriptions.


Developer plan limitations
--------------------------

Limitations of the Developer plan are:

* only our default region is available for deployment
* technical support is limited
* the application will be deleted if the account owner does not log in for 60 days
* after 30 minutes inactivity, the Live container sleeps, resulting in a short delay on waking up
* some additional services are not available

An application on a free Developer subscription may be upgraded with a paid subscription at any time.

If you have any questions regarding subscription, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us.
