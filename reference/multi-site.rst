Running multi-site applications
===============================

Divio offers flexible multi-site hosting.

A multi-site application serves multiple sites and domains within a single application. For example, an international
corporation may have a number of distinct country sites, each serving content in a particular set of languages.

Different options for multi-site applications on Divio are available depending on requirements.

Our mirror application functionality makes it possible for multiple sites to run the same code and share the same database and storage, while each runs as an independent application instance. This is a powerful, flexible and scalable architecture that allows sites to be allocated resources in a way that maximises efficiency.
